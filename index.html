                            <p class="card-text">All class acitivies are held online via Zoom—there is no in-person session for this class. We use a modified "flipped classroom" structure: each week I present a summary of the week's topic(s) during class and you watch pre-recorded videos that futher expand on the topic(s). During class we engage in discussion, demonstrations and some hands-on exercises where you can follow along on your own computer or work in groups. Class will meet via Zoom for 2–2.5 hours each week. Class discussion will not be recorded. You are expected to attend class and ask questions, as this will greatly aid in your understanding of the material.</p>

                    <p>As a software engineer&mdash;and, really, anyone in a software-related role&mdash;you must be familiar with cloud computing technologies since most new applications are developed and deployed “in the cloud”, and existing applications will often require integration with cloud-hosted services to take advantage of new capabilities. This course provides an introduction to cloud computing, with specific consideration for web-scale application development. We will focus primarily on infrastructure and platform services, and will introduce software-as-a-service from the perspective of a consuming application. The course will emphasize practical applications of cloud computing technologies, with sufficient exploration of their theoretical underpinnings to inform architectural, design, and implementation decisions. We will use commercial cloud services provided by Amazon Web Services to build and deploy cloud-hosted applications.</p>

                    <h4>Logistics</h4>
                    <p>We use a flipped classroom structure: each week you watch pre-recorded video lectures on that week's topic(s); during class hours we engage in discussion, demonstrations, hands-on exercises, and some live lectures. The week's videos are posted to Canvas two days prior to class. You can choose to watch them before or after class; I recommend watching them before class so you can ask more informed questions during class (this helps greatly with your understanding of the material).</p>

                    <p>We typically meet for two hours in class during most weeks. We don't run the full three hours in person as is common for a typical MPCS class, but each week you're expected to spend about the same amount of time, in total, between watching videos and in-person discussion.</p>

                    <h4>Topics</h4>
                    <p>The syllabus varies slightly each quarter, but we typically cover most of the following topics:</p>

                    <h4>Coursework</h4>
                    <p>Multiple programming assignments will be due each week. You are required to complete a subset of the assignments, and are encouraged to also work on a few optional assignments to enrich your learning. Many of the earlier programming assignments will provide components to be used in later assignments, so it is important to stay current on coursework.</p>

                    <h4>Prerequisites</h4>
                    <p>This course assumes no prior knowledge of cloud computing. Programming assignments require familiarity with Python and use of Linux commands, as well as simple shell scripts. We will use the <a target="_blank" href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html">boto3 SDK for Python</a> to access Amazon Web Services, and some assignments, including the capstone project, will make use of <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a>, a Python-based micro-framework for web applications. A brief overview of boto3, the web framework, as well as a list of reference materials will be provided; additional concepts will be introduced as they are needed to complete assignments.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Knowledge of web application development is not required, but students with little or no understanding of web methods may find assignments in this class particularly challenging. Ideally, you should understand the fundamentals of web APIs in general, and the REST approach in particular. An understanding of database concepts, such as referential integrity and ACID properties, is also useful.</p>

                    <p>There is no prescribed textbook for this course. We will refer to a variety of online resources, including selected readings on cloud concepts, programming guides for Amazon Web Services, and references for various technologies used in programming assignments. If you really want a book to refer to, of the myriad introductory cloud computing texts available I recommend "Cloud Computing for Science and Engineering", by Ian foster and Dennis Gannon.</p>

                    <h4>Our Safe Learning Environment</h4>
                    <p>The University and its faculty are committed to creating a safer and more inclusive learning environment for all students. At the University, all faculty, staff, graduate student instructors, and teaching assistants are considered <a target="_blank" href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/6/480/files/2016/12/Individuals-with-Reporting-Responsibilities_08-14-2020.pdf">“Individuals with Reporting Responsibilities”</a> and are required to let the University’s Title IX Coordinator know about any disclosures they receive from students, faculty, staff, other academic appointees, or postdoctoral researchers about experiences of sexual misconduct (including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and sexual harassment). This includes disclosures of experiences that happened before their time at the University. This is to ensure that all community members who have experienced sexual misconduct receive support, options, and information about their rights and resources. Community members are not obligated to respond to this outreach, and this will not generate a report to law enforcement.</p>

                    <p>For more information, please see this <a target="_blank" href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/b/3114/files/2016/12/Title-IX-Fact-Sheet-for-Students_11-08-20.pdf">handout for students</a> as well as the University’s <a target="_blank" href="https://harassmentpolicy.uchicago.edu/">Policy on Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://titleixpolicy.uchicago.edu/">Policy on Title IX Sexual Harassment</a>. You can also reach out directly for services and support from UChicago CARES by emailing titleix@uchicago.edu. If you, or another community member you know, wishes to speak to a confidential resource who does not have this reporting responsibility, please contact the Sexual Assault Dean on Call through the UChicago Safe App or at 773.834.HELP.</p>
